<h3>Online materials</h3>
<p>Post any questions regarding the course contents and organization on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/lr575o6i3nk330">Piazza</a>. We will monitor this discussion during business hours M-F. Unless they cover sensitive content, no questions sent in via e-mail will be answered! The homework is to be submitted on <a href="url">Gradescope</a>. The lecture notes etc. will be provided on <a href="https://github.com/kramlinger/STA220_WQ24">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>In this course we will learn how to acquire and process publicly available information from the internet. To this end, we will inspect the structure of websites, monitor their communication with servers, and retrieve the data we are interested in. The acquired data is then processed for further analysis, i.e., brought into tidy form, and visualized using static and interactive methods. Natural language data is processed to obtain insights into its topics or sentiments. </p>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>This course uses the standard UC Davis absolute grading scheme guaranteeing at least A- to students who score greater or equal than 90%, B- to students who score greater or equal 80%, C- to students who score greater or equal 70%, D- to students who score greater or equal 60%. The final grade is determined by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>40% homework</li>
    <li>60% final project</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>The homework will be published on GitHub two weeks before the due date. The solutions have to be typesetted as pdf and submitted in time. Late submissions are not accepted.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>The programming language Python is freely available at <a href="https://www.python.org/">python.org</a>. A popular integrated integrated development environment for Python is Spyder, available at <a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">spyder-ide.org</a>.
